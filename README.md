# My Personal Blog.

Source code for my personal landing page. I used @gohugoio and ~~@netlify~~ GitHub pages to create a very simple 
landing page with my own domain. 

Goals for the future: 

- [ ] Convert this README.md to show up on my profile.
- [ ] Start a blog at blog.anubhav.codes or anubhav.codes/blog
- [ ] Show a list of personal projects on my blog.
- [ ] Move away from gohugo and start something of your own.
- [x] Pull some metrics from grafana (personal instance) and show it on my website. 
- [x] Integrate an analytics site which also respects privacy of my readers (goatcounter??)

Right now I am happy with my simple landing page running over hugo using netlify, but I might want to replace hugo with Vue since I a not comfortable with go templating yet and I am actively learning Vue for work and personal projects.

### Development

```bash
make preview
```

go to localhost:8080 to test out the site.
