# My Personal Blog.

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/692e4513-ae76-420b-9315-99ade1cd53be/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/anubhavcodes/deploys)

Source code for my personal landing page. I used @gohugoio and @netlify to create a very simple landing page with my own domain. 

Goals for the future: 

- [ ]  Start a blog at blog.anubhav.codes or anubhav.codes/blog
- [ ] Show a list of personal projects on my blog.
- [ ] Pull some metrics from grafana (personal instance) and show it on my website. 
- [ ] Integrate an analytics site which also respects privacy of my readers (goatcounter??)

Right now I am happy with my simple landing page running over hugo using netlify, but I might want to replace hugo with Vue since I a not comfortable with go templating yet and I am actively learning Vue for work and personal projects.
